# XG – 4 SEASONS

```
Scratching the surface
Latching these words inside
It's more than just a purpose
I know you deserve it
Yeah I know
Can't find the reason
Why all this blue inside
Remembered like the movies
Space between the memories
So wide yeah
I know you been calling me lately
I've just been busy
Knowing you'll always be by mm
Wish I knew we were running out of time
Started in January gone in a minute
Thought it was summer? Maybe
Why is the wind blowing?
Not a day that goes by
Without you on my mind, all the time
(all the time)
(all the time)
Then came October, left in a hurry
The year is almost over
Snow came down early
Missing you ever more
As I'm passing these four seasons by
(season by)
(season by)
Stuck in this moment
I just need a minute, I'm fine
If only for a second
Hearing you will be perfect
For the night
Caught in the middle
Unravel this riddle, I'll try
Still reading all your messages
I'll never desert 'em, not I no
You must think I'm careless and jaded
Life's just been crazy
Quick hi, hellos and goodbyes mm
Wish I knew we were running out of time
Started in January gone in a minute
Thought it was summer? Maybe
Why is the wind blowing?
Not a day that goes by
Without you on my mind, all the time
(all the time)
(all the time)
Then came October, left in a hurry
The year is almost over
Snow came down early
Missing you ever more
As I'm passing these four seasons by
(season by)
(season by)
Can I speak honestly
I don't know why
I could never sleep, I tried
Couldn't figure it out
I don't wanna lose you in a loop inside
Call me a fool
Cause who am I to blame?
So please just stay
Rain drops fall down all seasons some how
Can't help but think of you in the sound
Waiting for days to come around
